what does it say about us as a culture that most of our microwaves have a dedicated popcorn button

i dont know but whatever it says, its magnified by literally every bag of popcorn saying "don't use the popcorn button"

Yo of all songs from that era why is it that Istanbul not Constantinople is one of the ones that survived to be known for decades after? Why is a fucking song written for the 500th anniversary of the fall of Constantinople not completely unknown today? Who even listened to it when it was recorded like why

It is increasingly obvious that most people have no idea how to indicate an illness is slowly killing someone without making them cough up blood. Doesn’t matter what it is or if it has anything to do with your respiratory system, if you’re dying, you’re coughing up blood.

Writers found out about tuberculosis and were like “damn this slaps” and we’ve been stuck with it ever since

I don't fucking care if it's manipulative, if your gf larps as an elf while talking to your relative who's undergoing chemo, you're allowed to humiliate her in front of her friends by larping as Naruto

If masks were necessary for our survival as a species we would have evolved one by now. We haven’t. We have noses and mouths. We have airways. It is not natural for people to go around with face masks on in their general life. And no amount of govt propaganda can change that. https://twitter.com/EmmaRoulstone/...

its like when a gender dies and all the scavengers come out and scuttle it for parts

crimid --- 

u know when you scope out a nice patch of gender for yourself but then you have to be on the lookout for predators because everyone wants a piece of that that tender meat

filial --- 

and later when the initial frenzy has died down and even the  stragglers have lost interest you still go back to the gender sometimes to chew upon its bones and even though itheyve been picked clean you swear you can still taste it in the brine

It seems like a lot of this “well none of this would be happening in a communist utopia” stuff is premised on the idea that politics must be easy because after all, it’s just people. It’s not something implacable and science-y like geological forces.

And it’s like dude. Friend. Bro-dawg. Have you ever met a person? Have you had the opportunity to interact with multiple of them at once?

Any proposal that begins “if everyone would just…”, is already doomed. Everyone will not just. Never in history has everyone just.

(On a related note, I was pretty amused to see someone suggest that it’s embarrassing we haven’t solved climate change yet because it’s “easy to fix if people would just work together.” That ‘work together’ part is, in fact, why we call them collective action problems.)

BY OUR deepest nature, we humans float in a world of familiar and comfortable but quite impossible-to-define abstract patterns, such as: “fast food” and “clamato juice”, “tackiness” and “wackiness”, “Christmas bonuses” and “customer service departments”, “wild goose chases” and “loose cannons”, “crackpots” and “feet of clay”, “slam dunks” and “bottom lines”, “lip service” and “elbow grease”, “dirty tricks” and “doggie bags”, “solo recitals” and “sleazeballs”, “sour grapes” and “soap operas”, “feedback” and “fair play”, “goals” and “lies”, “dreads” and “dreams”, “she” and “he” — and last but not least, “you” and “I”.
